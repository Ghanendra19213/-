### Projects
1. Real time Handwriting recognition
````
Developed a hardware and an android application
to gather real time strokes data of doctorâ€™s 
handwriting using a digital pen and (EMR ) electro
magnetic resonance board. ESP32 Bluetooth low 
energy microcontroller was used to capture data
from emr board and an API was used for real
time display of handwritten data of stroke.

2. Modular ECG Hardware Design [PCB](https://www.freelancer.in/u/ghanendra22/portfolio/Bluetooth-Low-Energy-RF-PCB-to-gather-ambient-light-data-4521156?w=f&ngsw-bypass=)
````
Designed two electrode ecg hardware boards for measurement of heart rate and a pulse oximeter to measure SpO2 levels in the blood, proof of
concept for Texas Instruments Innovation Challenge 2018. In this we used Texas Instruments ADC IC and BLE CC2640 IC with OPT 3001
sensor and captured data on android mobile app using TI's Sensor Tag.

3. Lab2Moon [Lunarleap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQhw1NQdp1o&feature=youtu.be)
````
Designed Proof of concept hardware for capturing microorganism called tardigrades or water bear which can survive extreme conditions using mini
microscope using open CV and Raspberry pi for Lab2Moon mission challenge team Lunar Leap.
````
4. Facial Motion Capture System [Startup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC6cnasY9sw)
````
Designed a complete prototype along with motion capture helmet hardware and software for a startup to capture real time facial landmarks along
with body motion suit and unreal engine integration.
````
5. Automatic Dough Sheeter Machine[Industrial](https://www.freelancer.in/u/ghanendra22/portfolio/Industrial-Automatic-Dough-Sheeter-Machine-used-in-Bakery-4521276?w=f&ngsw-bypass=)
````
Designed a touchscreen based user interface for automating the dough sheeter machine being used in the Bakery industry using raspberry pi,
arduino, Tkinter and using VFDs for controlling 3 phase induction motors.
````
6. Adaptive High Beam Control of Vehicles [IEEE](https://transmitter.ieee.org/makerproject/view/28283)
````
Designed an adaptive high beam control for vehicles during night time based on incoming vehicle headlight intensity vehicles switch high beam
to low beam for proper visibility.
Also in blind corner turns, based on steering wheel, headlights shift for proper visibility. This technology was used in Mazda cars series.
````
7. Haptic Feedback VR Glove[HackIndia](https://devpost.com/software/feelvr)
````
We designed a prototype glove to emulate force feedback in virtual reality for fingers using force and vibration sensors.
